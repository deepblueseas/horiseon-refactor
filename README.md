# Code Refactor - Challenge 01


## DESCRIPTION

### Goal
    -My goal was to refactor the html of the Horiseon webpage 
    -In order to make it more accessible and optimized for search engines.  
    -The starter code provided by Georgeyoo (see notes for credit) contained no html elements
    -Which builds a perfectly functioning website, but it doesn't offer guidance for screen readers
    -Additionally, the website is more likely to show up in top search results 
    -If it is clear what the main topics of the site are.

### Actions
    -I did this by adding semantic elements to the existing html code 
    -In order to make it communicate more clearly with screen readers 
    -Or search engines looking for the main header, for example.  
    -I also added alt attributions to the image elements 
    -To provide screen readers with an image description.  
    -Finally, one of the links in the original code was broken, so I fixed that. 

### Lessons Learned
    -In working on this project, 
    -I was able to learn a lot about troubleshooting the terminal, Github, and my local respository.  
    -Being able to poke around in code with the webpage pulled up in live view 
    -Was a good lesson in understanding html better.  
    -I still have a lot to learn, 
    -But I have a more solid grasp on the things that aren't quite clinking yet.  
    -For example, I really need to work on my README's and deploying on GitHub
